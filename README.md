# cache-hierarchy-simulator
Simulated various cache configurations utilizing the WBWA write policy and LRU replacement policy. Hierarchies simulated include: L1, L1+L2, and L1 with stream buffers. Reconfigurable parameters were cache size, associativity, and block size. This data was analyzed to draw conclusions regarding how cache parameters affect performance. Performance of different cache configurations was done in Python and Excel was used to create graphs.
